                    <p>tell us about a time that you failed in a professional</p>

                        In my App Development class, I was project manager of a programming team working to create a React Hooks app for use within the food industry. 
                        I came to notice a member lacking in their contributions, which was consequential in impacting the group’s workload. 
                        I failed in quickly addressing this situation out of discomfort and fear towards confrontation. 
                        By not communicating swiftly, being passive at the time was excusing poor performance and not good for morale. I overcame this failure when I acknowledged the importance of 
                        leaders in upholding accountability for expected behaviors. I engaged in private conversations with the team member, exercising assertiveness in expressing concerns while also listening carefully. 
                        Ultimately the performance issues were addressed head-on and resolved, allowing for the final project to be delivered complete and on time.

                        March of this year, I photo assisted a shoot for the Adidas Originals Spring Pastels campaign. It was a big campaign, and all the content was shared across several media platforms, including Instagram, website, in-app, and email. 
                        I worked with the team of models and a stylist to creatively direct execution of the looks and shot the campaign using 35mm film. Working as a collective to connect our strategy and creativity allowed me to bring the vision of Adidas Originals to reality. 
                        I am proud of the final product and the message it depicts, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with such a global sports brand.

                        As a computer science major, much of my academics consists of mathematical and technological exploration. Much of my life and outside of school activities is fueled by a passion for design and visual directions. 
                        The qualities falling under both umbrellas revolve around analytical and creative thinking, this creates value in my versatility of skills. I love to work in teams and build relationships with others, 
                        prioritizing people allows me to produce personal and more creatively driven contributions. RPA is a an agency that puts people first, a climate in which I can go above and beyond for the client, because I see the value in personal connection. 
                        I also highly value efficiency and quality, doing all tasks timely and as detail oriented as possible. In previous experience, I have worked with regular hard deadlines and high quality standards, working to deliver consistent growth.
